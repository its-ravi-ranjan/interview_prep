# Are Right, A Lot

## Definition
**Strong judgment and instincts. Seek diverse perspectives. Work to disconfirm beliefs.**

## STAR Pattern Examples

Story: Funnel logic — if-else vs scalable design
S: My senior suggested using simple if-else for loan funnel logic.
T: Initially agreed, but I later realized it wouldn't scale as logic increased.
A: I pushed for a configurable and dynamic funnel engine. Designed and coded it.
R: This became the standard and made future logic changes easy — with fewer bugs and no rewrites.



### Example 1: Database Architecture Decision
**Situation**: Team debating between SQL and NoSQL for new user profile system with mixed data requirements
**Task**: Make correct architectural decision based on data analysis and future requirements
**Action**:
- Analyzed data access patterns and identified 80% read operations
- Evaluated data consistency requirements and found eventual consistency acceptable
- Researched team expertise and found strong SQL knowledge
- Predicted future scaling needs based on business projections
- Made decision to use PostgreSQL with read replicas for scaling
**Result**: System handles 10x more traffic than expected, easy to maintain, validated decision through performance metrics

### Example 2: Caching Strategy Selection
**Situation**: Need to choose between Redis and Memcached for session management with high availability requirements
**Task**: Select optimal caching solution based on technical requirements and business needs
**Action**:
- Evaluated persistence requirements and found Redis persistence needed
- Analyzed data structure complexity and identified need for hash operations
- Assessed team expertise and found Redis knowledge available
- Considered future features requiring pub/sub and sorted sets
- Made decision to use Redis with cluster configuration
**Result**: Successfully implemented session management, added pub/sub features later, system scales to 1M+ users

### Example 3: Microservice vs Monolith Decision
**Situation**: New payment processing system with unclear team size and complexity requirements
**Task**: Choose correct architecture pattern for long-term success
**Action**:
- Analyzed team size (3 developers) and found insufficient for microservices
- Evaluated system complexity and identified moderate complexity level
- Assessed deployment and monitoring capabilities
- Predicted future requirements based on business roadmap
- Made decision to start with modular monolith with clear service boundaries
**Result**: Delivered system on time, easy to maintain, prepared for future microservice migration when team grows

## Key Backend Focus Areas
- **Technical Judgment**: Making correct decisions based on data and experience
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Using metrics and analysis to inform choices
- **Future Planning**: Considering long-term implications of decisions
- **Team Assessment**: Evaluating team capabilities and expertise
- **Risk Evaluation**: Understanding trade-offs and potential issues

## Interview Tips
- Show how you gather data and diverse perspectives before making decisions
- Demonstrate ability to predict outcomes based on technical analysis
- Highlight decisions that were validated by subsequent results
- Show willingness to change decisions based on new information
- Emphasize learning from both successful and unsuccessful decisions
