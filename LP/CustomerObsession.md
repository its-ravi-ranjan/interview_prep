# Customer Obsession

## Definition
**Start with the customer, work backwards. Earn and keep customer trust.**

## STAR Pattern Examples
#
Story: Funnel visibility for collections ops
S: Loan recovery teams needed better visibility into account recovery states.
T: My manager asked for a fast solution to track these states.
A: I designed and delivered a funnel engine that displays exact stage transitions based on rules.
R: Teams now have real-time visibility into every account's recovery status, improving operational decisions.

### Example 1: Production Bug Fix
**Situation**: Critical production bug causing 500 errors for 10% of users during peak hours
**Task**: Debug and fix the issue within 2 hours to minimize customer impact
**Action**: 
- Immediately investigated logs and identified root cause in database connection pool exhaustion
- Implemented hotfix by increasing connection pool size and adding circuit breaker
- Deployed fix through blue-green deployment to ensure zero downtime
- Set up monitoring alerts to prevent future occurrences
**Result**: Resolved issue within 1.5 hours, restored service for all affected customers, implemented preventive measures

### Example 2: API Performance Optimization
**Situation**: Customer complaints about slow API response times (3+ seconds) affecting mobile app experience
**Task**: Optimize API performance to achieve sub-500ms response times
**Action**:
- Analyzed slow query logs and identified N+1 query problem in user profile endpoint
- Implemented database query optimization with proper indexing
- Added Redis caching layer for frequently accessed user data
- Implemented database connection pooling and query result caching
**Result**: Reduced API response time from 3s to 200ms, improved customer satisfaction scores by 40%

### Example 3: Data Loss Prevention
**Situation**: Customer reported missing transaction data after system maintenance
**Task**: Investigate and recover lost data while ensuring data integrity
**Action**:
- Immediately reviewed backup logs and identified data corruption during maintenance
- Restored data from point-in-time backup and validated integrity
- Implemented additional backup verification processes
- Created automated data consistency checks for future maintenance windows
**Result**: Recovered 100% of lost data, implemented preventive measures, maintained customer trust

## Key Backend Focus Areas
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Proactive issue detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast, reliable API responses
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring customer data safety
- **Incident Response**: Quick resolution of production issues
- **Backup & Recovery**: Protecting customer data

## Interview Tips
- Always start with customer impact when describing technical decisions
- Quantify results in terms of customer experience (response times, uptime, etc.)
- Show how technical solutions directly benefit customers
- Demonstrate understanding of customer needs through technical implementation
