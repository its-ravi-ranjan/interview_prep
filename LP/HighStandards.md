# High Standards

## Definition
**Relentlessly high standards. Raise the bar. Fix problems so they stay fixed.**

## STAR Pattern Examples

#
Story: DB stream + Kafka refactor
S: After fixing the DB stream Kafka worker, I could have stopped at “it works.”
T: But I wanted it production-grade.
A: I added detailed logging, retry handling, error monitoring, and load testing.
R: The solution has been running smoothly since, with no hidden bugs or silent failures.



### Example 1: Code Quality Standards Implementation
**Situation**: Team struggling with code quality issues causing frequent production bugs and technical debt
**Task**: Establish and enforce high coding standards across the team
**Action**:
- Implemented comprehensive code review process with mandatory approval
- Set up automated code quality checks (SonarQube, ESLint, Checkstyle)
- Established unit test coverage requirements (minimum 80%)
- Created coding standards documentation and best practices guide
- Implemented automated testing pipeline with quality gates
- Conducted regular code quality workshops and training sessions
**Result**: Reduced production bugs by 70%, improved code maintainability, established sustainable quality culture

### Example 2: API Design Standards
**Situation**: Inconsistent API design patterns causing integration issues and poor developer experience
**Task**: Establish high standards for API design and documentation
**Action**:
- Created comprehensive API design guidelines following REST principles
- Implemented OpenAPI/Swagger documentation standards
- Established API versioning strategy and backward compatibility requirements
- Set up automated API testing with contract validation
- Created API performance benchmarks and monitoring standards
- Implemented API governance process with mandatory reviews
**Result**: Improved API consistency by 90%, reduced integration time by 50%, enhanced developer productivity

### Example 3: Database Performance Standards
**Situation**: Database queries causing performance issues and inconsistent response times
**Task**: Establish high standards for database design and query performance
**Action**:
- Implemented database design review process with performance requirements
- Established query performance benchmarks (sub-100ms for 95% of queries)
- Created database indexing strategy and optimization guidelines
- Set up automated query performance monitoring and alerting
- Implemented database migration standards with rollback procedures
- Established regular database performance reviews and optimization sessions
**Result**: Improved query performance by 300%, reduced database-related incidents by 80%, established performance culture

## Key Backend Focus Areas
- **Code Quality**: Establishing and maintaining high coding standards
- **Testing Standards**: Ensuring comprehensive test coverage and quality
- **Performance Standards**: Setting and achieving performance benchmarks
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintaining high-quality technical documentation
- **Process Standards**: Establishing efficient and reliable development processes

## Interview Tips
- Show commitment to quality even when it requires extra effort
- Demonstrate how you've raised standards in your team or organization
- Highlight specific standards you've established and their impact
- Show how you ensure standards are maintained over time
- Emphasize the long-term benefits of high standards
