# DSA & OOPs Practice – Java & JavaScript Side by Side

Welcome to this repository! 🎯  
This project is designed for **students and professionals** preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or building strong fundamentals in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── java/         # Java solutions
└── javascript/   # JavaScript solutions
Each folder contains the same DSA and OOPs problems solved in both Java and JavaScript. This allows you to:

👨‍💻 Compare implementations across languages

🚀 Learn how logic translates between statically and dynamically typed languages

🧠 Strengthen your understanding regardless of your core language choice

✅ What's Covered
🔹 Array & String problems

🔹 Linked List, Stack, Queue

🔹 Trees, Graphs

🔹 Recursion & Backtracking

🔹 Sorting & Searching

🔹 Dynamic Programming

🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts:

Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

Class design and real-world examples

📌 Who Should Use This Repo?
🧑‍🎓 Students preparing for FAANG or product-based company interviews

💼 Working professionals switching stacks or strengthening fundamentals

🔁 Developers who want to understand Java ↔ JavaScript logic mapping

🚧 How to Contribute
