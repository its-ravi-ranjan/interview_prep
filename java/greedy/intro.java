 * ========================================
 * GREEDY ALGORITHMS - COMPLETE GUIDE
 * ========================================
 * 
 * What is a Greedy Algorithm?
 * -----------------------------
 * A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a global optimum.
 * It never looks back or changes previous decisions.
 * 
 * Key Principles:
 * ---------------
 * 1. Greedy Choice Property: Locally optimal choice leads to globally optimal solution
 * 2. Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution contains optimal sub-solutions
 * 3. No Backtracking: Once a choice is made, it's never reconsidered
 * 4. Simple and Fast: Usually O(n log n) or O(n) time complexity
 * 
 * Visual Example:
 * 
 * Activity Selection: Choose maximum non-overlapping activities
 * 
 * Activities: [1,4], [2,6], [5,7], [3,8], [5,9]
 * Sorted by end time: [1,4], [2,6], [5,7], [3,8], [5,9]
 * Greedy choice: Always pick activity with earliest end time
 * Result: [1,4], [5,7] - 2 activities
 * 
 * ========================================
 * WHEN TO RECOGNIZE GREEDY PROBLEMS
 * ========================================
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ 5. Ninja Techniques to Recognize Greedy Problems
 * 
 * âœ… "Activity selection" â€” pick optimal activities
 *    Examples: Meeting rooms, job scheduling, task assignment
 *    Pattern: Need to select maximum non-overlapping activities
 * 
 * âœ… "Fractional knapsack" â€” take items partially
 *    Examples: Loading truck, resource allocation, profit maximization
 *    Pattern: Can take fractional amounts of items
 * 
 * âœ… "Huffman coding" â€” build optimal prefix codes
 *    Examples: Data compression, file encoding, character frequency
 *    Pattern: Need to build optimal binary tree for encoding
 * 
 * âœ… "Minimum spanning tree" â€” connect all nodes
 *    Examples: Network wiring, road construction, cluster analysis
 *    Pattern: Need to connect all nodes with minimum cost
 * 
 * âœ… "Coin change" â€” minimum coins for amount
 *    Examples: Vending machine, cash register, payment systems
 *    Pattern: Need minimum number of coins for given amount
 * 
 * âœ… "Interval scheduling" â€” schedule events optimally
 *    Examples: Class scheduling, meeting rooms, resource booking
 *    Pattern: Need to schedule maximum events without conflicts
 * 
 * ========================================
 * GREEDY ALGORITHM TYPES
 * ========================================
 * 
 * 1. SELECTION PROBLEMS
 * ----------------------
 * Use: Choose optimal subset from given options
 * Strategy: Sort and select based on criteria
 * Time: O(n log n) - sorting
 * Space: O(1) - in-place
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Activity Selection: Sort by end time, pick earliest ending
 * - Job Scheduling: Sort by deadline, schedule earliest deadline
 * - Meeting Rooms: Sort by start time, assign to available room
 * 
 * 2. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
 * -------------------------
 * Use: Find optimal value (min/max) with constraints
 * Strategy: Make locally optimal choice at each step
 * Time: O(n log n) - usually involves sorting
 * Space: O(1) - constant extra space
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Fractional Knapsack: Sort by value/weight ratio
 * - Minimum Coins: Use largest denomination first
 * - Maximum Profit: Sort by profit, take highest
 * 
 * 3. CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS
 * -------------------------
 * Use: Build optimal structure step by step
 * Strategy: Add elements in optimal order
 * Time: O(n log n) - building and maintaining structure
 * Space: O(n) - store the structure
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Huffman Coding: Build tree from frequency
 * - Minimum Spanning Tree: Add edges in order of weight
 * - Optimal Merge: Merge smallest files first
 *

 * 
 * Java Greedy Implementation:
 * ----------------------------
 * 
 * // Activity Selection
 * public int maxActivities(int[][] activities) {
 *     // Sort by end time
 *     Arrays.sort(activities, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
 *     
 *     int count = 0;
 *     int lastEnd = 0;
 *     
 *     for (int[] activity : activities) {
 *         if (activity[0] >= lastEnd) {
 *             count++;
 *             lastEnd = activity[1];
 *         }
 *     }
 *     return count;
 * }
 * 
 * // Fractional Knapsack
 * public double fractionalKnapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
 *     int n = weights.length;
 *     double[][] items = new double[n][3]; // [index, value/weight, weight]
 *     
 *     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 *         items[i][0] = i;
 *         items[i][1] = (double) values[i] / weights[i];
 *         items[i][2] = weights[i];
 *     }
 *     
 *     // Sort by value/weight ratio (descending)
 *     Arrays.sort(items, (a, b) -> Double.compare(b[1], a[1]));
 *     
 *     double totalValue = 0;
 *     int remainingCapacity = capacity;
 *     
 *     for (double[] item : items) {
 *         if (remainingCapacity >= item[2]) {
 *             totalValue += values[(int)item[0]];
 *             remainingCapacity -= item[2];
 *         } else {
 *             totalValue += item[1] * remainingCapacity;
 *             break;
 *         }
 *     }
 *     return totalValue;
 * }
 * 
 * // Minimum Coins
 * public int minCoins(int[] coins, int amount) {
 *     Arrays.sort(coins); // Sort in descending order
 *     int count = 0;
 *     
 *     for (int i = coins.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
 *         while (amount >= coins[i]) {
 *             amount -= coins[i];
 *             count++;
 *         }
 *     }
 *     return amount == 0 ? count : -1;
 * }

 * 
 * 2. IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
 *    - Start by sorting the input
 *    - Make greedy choice at each step
 *    - Don't look back or change previous decisions
