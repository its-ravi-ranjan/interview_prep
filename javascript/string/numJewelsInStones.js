/**
 * Jewels and Stones
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
 * and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type 
 * of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 * 
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is different from "A".
 * jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
 * All characters in jewels are unique.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Approach 1:
 * Use two nested loops: Outer loop over stones, inner loop over jewels.
 * If a character in stones matches any in jewels, increment the count.
 * Break inner loop once matched to avoid redundant checks.
 * 
 * Approach 2:
 * Use a Set (or hash set) to store all characters from jewels.
 * Loop through each character in stones.
 * Increment a counter for every character found in the jewels set.
 * 
 * Time and Space Complexity:
 * Approach 1: Time O(m Ã— n), Space O(1)
 * Approach 2: Time O(n + m), Space O(1)
